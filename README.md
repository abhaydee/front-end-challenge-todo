# Customized Todo List Application

## About the Project

We all know that a Typical to-do list web application helps a developer understand the CRUD functionalities of the web. I always wanted to build a to-do application rich in UI, yet simple and easier to use.
It also comes with a unique dark mode theme for all those AMOLED screens out there. This website is going to look amazing on your phones and desktops. I have given it an honest try.
